# Deep Smoke Segmentation

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00774v1.pdf

Inspired by the recent success of fully convolutional networks  (FCN)  in  semantic  segmentation,  we  propose  a  deep  smoke  segmentation  network  to  infer  high  quality  segmentation  masks from blurry smoke images. To overcome large variations in texture,  color  and  shape  of  smoke  appearance,  we  divide  the  proposed network into a coarse path and a fine path. The first path is  an  encoder-decoder  FCN  with  skip  structures,  which  extracts  global context information of smoke and accordingly generates a coarse segmentation mask. To retain fine spatial details of smoke, the second path is also designed as an encoder-decoder FCN with skip  structures,  but  it  is  shallower  than  the  first  path  network.  Finally,  we  propose  a  very  small  network  containing  only  add,  convolution  and  activation  layers  to  fuse  the  results  of  the  two  paths. Thus, we can easily train the proposed network end to end for  simultaneous  optimization  of  network  parameters.  To  avoid  the  difficulty  in  manually  labelling  fuzzy  smoke  objects,  we  propose a method to generate synthetic smoke images. According to  results  of  our  deep  segmentation  method,  we  can  easily  and  accurately perform smoke detection from videos. Experiments on three synthetic smoke datasets and a realistic smoke dataset show that our method achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art  segmentation  algorithms  based  on  FCNs.  Test  results  of  our method on videos are also appealing.
