# 这是一个新的工具

可以直接在md格式的html文件中插入一个脚本链接，提供渲染支持。

这里是一个例子：

```
In mathematics, **Euler's identity** is the equality
$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. $$

Euler's identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex
analysis, which states that for any real number $ x $,
$$ e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x. $$
```

# Atomic Theory

**Atomic theory** is a scientific theory of the nature of matter, which
states that matter is composed of discrete units called *atoms*. It
began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the
scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the
field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were
made up of atoms.

或者使用`texme`的附加支持
